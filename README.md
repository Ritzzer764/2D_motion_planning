## Finding Nearest Neighbour
I used two algorithms to find the nearest neighbors of points:-
* Euclidean distance (cdist)
* K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm

### Euclidean distance (cdist)
I found that when utilizing cdist to create the network of nearest neighbours, I only had to use a few sample of points (600) to pass all 
the test cases.
This is the network created using 600 points of cdist:

This is the shortest path for the test case:

which I had tested the algorithm with. It was able to find the shortest path in all cases.
